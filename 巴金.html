<p>一、人生轨迹：从叛逆青年到文坛泰斗</p>
 
<p>1. 早年觉醒（1904-1928）：出生于封建官僚大家庭，目睹家族腐朽与礼教压迫，“五四”运动后深受新思潮洗礼，1923年离家求学，辗转上海、南京等地。1927年赴法留学期间，完成处女作《灭亡》，首次使用“巴金”笔名，借革命青年杜大心的反抗，宣泄对黑暗社会的憎恨。</p>
2. 创作巅峰（1929-1949）：1928年回国后进入创作爆发期，1933年《家》的发表奠定文坛地位，随后陆续完成《春》《秋》（“激流三部曲”）、《雾》《雨》《电》（“爱情三部曲”）。抗战时期投身救亡运动，编辑《救亡日报》，创作《火》（抗战三部曲）；后期转向现实批判，《憩园》《第四病室》《寒夜》等作品，将笔触聚焦底层苦难，艺术风格更趋成熟。
<p>3. 晚年反思（1950-2005）：历经时代变迁后，1978年起以40万言写就《随想录》，直面“文革”创伤与自身人格扭曲，呼吁建立“文革”博物馆，践行“揪出示众的首先是自己”的忏悔精神。晚年获意大利但丁国际荣誉奖、法国荣誉勋章等多项国际殊荣，2005年在上海逝世，享年101岁。</p>

 <p>Ba Jin: The Conscience of 20th-Century China</p>
 
Ba Jin (November 25, 1904 – October 17, 2005), formerly named Li Yaotang and styled Fu Gan, was originally from Chengdu, Sichuan. As a giant of modern Chinese literature, an important writer after the May Fourth New Culture Movement, and former Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, he upheld the sincerity of "giving his heart to readers," used his words to convey the era’s themes of anti-feudalism and pursuit of freedom, and in his later years erected a spiritual monument of "speaking the truth" with Random Thoughts, known as "the conscience of 20th-century China."
 
<p>I. Life Trajectory: From Rebellious Youth to Literary Master</p>
 
1. Early Awakening (1904-1928)
Born into a feudal bureaucratic family, he witnessed the decay of the clan and the oppression of feudal ethics. After the May Fourth Movement, he was deeply influenced by new ideological trends. In 1923, he left home to pursue studies, traveling to Shanghai, Nanjing and other places. During his study in France in 1927, he completed his debut work Destruction, using the pen name "Ba Jin" for the first time. Through the resistance of the revolutionary youth Du Daxin, he vented his hatred for the dark society.
<p>2. Creative Peak (1929-1949)</p>
After returning to China in 1928, he entered a period of creative explosion. The publication of Family in 1933 established his status in the literary circle, followed by the completion of Spring and Autumn (collectively known as "The Torrent Trilogy"), and Fog, Rain and Electricity (collectively known as "The Love Trilogy"). During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he joined the national salvation movement, edited Salvation Daily, and created Fire (The War of Resistance Trilogy). In his later years, he turned to realistic criticism; works such as The Garden of Repose, The Fourth Ward and Cold Nights focused on the hardships of the underclass, and his artistic style became more mature.
<p>3. Late Reflections (1950-2005)</p>
After experiencing the changes of the times, he wrote Random Thoughts with 400,000 words starting from 1978, facing up to the trauma of the "Cultural Revolution" and the distortion of his own personality, calling for the establishment of a "Cultural Revolution" museum, and practicing the spirit of confession of "first exposing oneself to the public." In his later years, he received many international honors such as the Italian Dante International Honor Award and the French Legion of Honor. He passed away in Shanghai in 2005 at the age of 101.
 
<p>II. Core Works and Ideological Core</p>
 
<p>1. In-depth Analysis of Masterpieces</p>
 
- The Torrent Trilogy (Family, Spring, Autumn): Based on his own family, it depicts the collapse of a feudal big family. In Family, Juehui’s rebellion, Mingfeng’s drowning, and Ruijue’s tragic death directly point to the destruction of human nature by feudal ethics, eulogizing the democratic awakening of the younger generation. Lu Xun praised him as "a passionate writer with progressive ideas."
- Cold Nights (1947): The pinnacle of Ba Jin’s novel creation, focusing on the family tragedy of Wang Wenxuan, a low-level clerk in Chongqing in the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Through marital estrangement, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts, and survival difficulties, it exposes the annihilation of intellectuals’ ideals by the old system, with cold and restrained writing, showing the desolation of the turbulent times.
- Random Thoughts (1979-1986): Known as "the confession of contemporary Chinese literature," it reflects on history and dissects oneself in the form of essays, putting forward the literary proposition of "speaking the truth," providing important enlightenment for the reconstruction of national spirit, and is a spiritual wealth spanning the times.
 
<p>2. Core Creative Ideas</p>
 
- Always adhering to the main line of anti-feudalism and pursuit of freedom, speaking for oppressed youth and women, and denouncing the decay of the old system.
- Upholding humanistic care, eulogizing the revolutionary youth’s spirit of sacrifice and sympathizing with the survival hardships of the underclass.
- In his later years, he elevated to self-criticism and historical reflection, practicing the social responsibility of intellectuals with "truth-telling literature."
 
<p>III. Literary Style and Historical Status</p>
 
- Style Characteristics: His language is simple and fluent, with sincere and intense emotions. His early works are full of idealistic passion and rebellious power, while his later works turn to profound and restrained realistic criticism, combining ideological content and appeal. "Giving his heart to readers" is the core criterion of his creation.
- Historical Influence: He promoted the development of realism in modern Chinese literature. Works such as Family have influenced the ideological awakening of generations of youth, becoming classic models of anti-feudal literature. His spirit of "speaking the truth" and humanistic feelings still have profound value across the times, making him one of the important representatives of Chinese literature "going global."
