<p>Lao She: A Giant of Modern Chinese Literature</p>
 
Lao She (February 3, 1899 – August 24, 1966), formerly named Shu Qingchun and styled Sheyu, was a Manchu born in Beijing. As a literary giant of modern China, the "People's Artist," and founder of Beijing-style literature, he became the "painter of urban soul" depicting all walks of life in old Beijing with authentic Beijing dialect, humorous tone, and profound social insight.
 
<p>I. Life Trajectory: From Manchu Bannerman's Son to Literary Master</p>
 
1. Early Hardships and Enlightenment (1899-1924)
Born into a declining Manchu imperial guard family, his father died in the Boxer Uprising. His mother supported the family by washing and mending clothes, and the impoverished life made him deeply understand the hardships of the underclass. After primary school, he was admitted to the free Beijing Normal School. After graduation, he served as a primary school principal and middle school teacher, while studying English to accumulate diverse knowledge.
<p>2. Literary Debut in Britain (1924-1930)</p>
Employed as a lecturer in Chinese at the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, he embarked on his literary career. In 1926, he serialized his first full-length novel The Philosophy of Lao Zhang, which shook the literary circle with its realistic writing and unique humor. Subsequently, he published Zhao Ziyue and Mr. Ma and Son, establishing his status as a pioneer of new literature.
3. Golden Period of Literary Creation (1930-1937)
After returning to China, he taught at Qilu University and Shandong University, entering his creative prime. He produced classics such as Camel Xiangzi, Divorce, and Crescent Moon. Among them, Camel Xiangzi, through the tragic fate of a rickshaw puller, became an immortal work criticizing the old society.
<p>4. Perseverance During the War of Resistance and Post-War Period (1937-1949)</p>
He joined the national resistance against Japanese aggression, serving as Director of the General Affairs Department of the National Association of Writers and Artists for Resistance Against Aggression, and strived to promote unity in the literary and artistic circles. In 1944, he began writing his magnum opus Four Generations Under One Roof, a million-word novel depicting the eight-year War of Resistance through the alley life of occupied Beijing.
5. Creative Peak in New China (1949-1966)
Returning from the United States, he enthusiastically praised the new life and created masterpieces such as Dragon Beard Ditch and Teahouse. He was awarded the title of "People's Artist" for Dragon Beard Ditch, and Teahouse became the pinnacle of Chinese drama, translated into multiple languages and spreading overseas.
