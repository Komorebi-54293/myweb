        <h2>鲁迅</h2>
        <p>现代文学奠基人，“民族魂”，以《呐喊》《阿Q正传》《祝福》尖锐批判封建礼教与国民劣根性，杂文堪称“投枪与匕首”。</p>
    </div>
鲁迅（1881年9月25日－1936年10月19日），原名周树人，字豫才，浙江绍兴人，是中国现代文学奠基人、新文化运动旗手、思想启蒙者，以“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”的人格，用文字刺破时代阴霾，被誉为“民族魂”，是理解现代中国绕不开的精神坐标。
 
<p>一、人生轨迹：从医者到文坛战士</p>
 
1. 早年求索（1881-1906）：出生于没落封建士大夫家庭，家道中落让他目睹世态炎凉。1902年赴日留学，最初专攻医学，希望以医术救治国人身体，后在课堂观看日俄战争“中国人围观同胞被斩首”的幻灯片，顿悟“愚弱的国民，再强健的体魄也只能做示众的材料”，遂弃医从文，立志以文字唤醒民族精神。
<p>2. 文坛崛起（1907-1927）：1918年以“鲁迅”为笔名，在《新青年》发表中国现代文学史上第一篇成熟白话文小说《狂人日记》，震动文坛。随后陆续推出《呐喊》《彷徨》《野草》等经典，1921年《阿Q正传》连载，成为国民性批判的巅峰之作。这一时期，他积极参与新文化运动，倡导白话文，推动文学革命。</p>
3. 战斗岁月（1927-1936）：1927年定居上海后，转向杂文创作，以“投枪匕首”般的文字批判封建残余、社会黑暗与文化虚伪，先后主编《语丝》《奔流》等刊物，扶持青年作家。期间屡遭反动势力迫害，却始终坚守独立批判立场，直至1936年因肺病逝世，灵柩覆盖“民族魂”大旗，数万民众自发送行。
 
<p>二、核心作品与思想内核</p>
 
<p>1. 代表作深度解析</p>
 
- 小说集《呐喊》《彷徨》：《呐喊》收录《狂人日记》《孔乙己》《药》《故乡》等，以冷峻笔触揭露封建礼教吃人本质，歌颂觉醒者的反抗；《彷徨》含《祝福》《伤逝》等，聚焦知识分子与底层民众的困境，探讨“启蒙后的迷茫”，两部作品共同奠定现代现实主义小说的基石。
- 《阿Q正传》：塑造“阿Q”这一经典形象，以其“精神胜利法”讽刺国民麻木、自欺的劣根性，成为剖析民族性格的永恒范本，被译成数十种语言传遍世界。
- 散文诗集《野草》：以奇崛意象与深邃哲思，书写孤独与抗争，如《过客》《秋夜》，兼具诗意与批判力量，是中国现代散文诗的巅峰。
- 散文集《朝花夕拾》：回忆童年、求学与故人，《从百草园到三味书屋》《藤野先生》等篇，温情中藏反思，文字质朴却动人。
- 杂文集《热风》《华盖集》等：将杂文升华为社会批判利器，语言犀利、逻辑严密，“揭出病苦，引起疗救的注意”，影响后世杂文创作范式。
 
<p>2. 思想核心</p>
 
- 核心是“立人”与启蒙：批判封建礼教对人性的压抑，呼吁个性解放与精神独立，希望通过思想觉醒实现民族复兴。
- 坚持国民性批判：深刻剖析麻木、愚昧、自私等民族劣根性，目的不是嘲讽，而是唤醒反思。

- 精神遗产：“真的猛士，敢于直面惨淡的人生”“世上本没有路，走的人多了，也便成了路”等名句，已融入民族语言与精神血脉。
- 教育与传播：作品入选语文教材数量居首位，影响数代国人；全球译本众多，萨特等西方名家盛赞其批判精神，成为中国文学“走出去”的核心代表。

 <p>Lu Xun: The Soul of the Nation and Founder of Modern Chinese Literature</p>
 
Lu Xun (September 25, 1881 – October 19, 1936), formerly named Zhou Shuren and styled Yucai, was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. As the founder of modern Chinese literature, a standard-bearer of the New Culture Movement, and an ideological enlightenment pioneer, he pierced the haze of the era with his writings, embodying the spirit of "Fierce-browed, I defy a thousand pointing fingers; Head-bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children." Hailed as "the soul of the nation," he is an indispensable spiritual touchstone for understanding modern China.
 
<p>I. Life Trajectory: From Physician to Literary Warrior</p>
 
1. Early Exploration (1881-1906)
Born into a declining feudal scholar-official family, the fall of his family made him witness the coldness of human relationships. He went to Japan to study in 1902, initially specializing in medicine with the hope of curing the physical ailments of his compatriots. However, after watching a slideshow during a class depicting "Chinese people watching as their compatriot was beheaded" in the Russo-Japanese War, he suddenly realized: "A weak-willed nation, no matter how strong their bodies, can only serve as spectacle for others." Thus, he abandoned medicine for literature, resolving to awaken the national spirit through his writings.
<p>2. Rise in the Literary Circle (1907-1927)</p>
In 1918, under the pen name "Lu Xun," he published Diary of a Madman—the first mature modern vernacular novel in Chinese literary history—in New Youth, shaking the literary world. Subsequently, he launched classics such as Call to Arms, Wanderings, and Wild Grass. In 1921, The True Story of Ah Q was serialized, becoming the pinnacle of his critique of national character. During this period, he actively participated in the New Culture Movement, advocating vernacular Chinese and promoting the literary revolution.
3. Years of Struggle (1927-1936)
After settling in Shanghai in 1927, he turned to essay writing, using his "spear and dagger-like" words to criticize feudal remnants, social darkness, and cultural hypocrisy. He successively edited journals such as Yu Si (Thread of Discourse) and Ben Liu (Rushing Stream), supporting young writers. Persecuted repeatedly by reactionary forces, he always adhered to an independent critical stance until his death from lung disease in 1936. His coffin was covered with a large flag inscribed with "the soul of the nation," and tens of thousands of people attended his funeral voluntarily.
 
<p>II. Core Works and Ideological Core</p>
 
<p>1. In-depth Analysis of Masterpieces</p>
 
- Short Story Collections: Call to Arms and Wanderings
Call to Arms includes works such as Diary of a Madman, Kong Yiji, Medicine, and My Old Home, exposing the cannibalistic nature of feudal ethics with a cold pen and eulogizing the resistance of awakened individuals. Wanderings contains The New Year’s Sacrifice and Regret for the Past, focusing on the predicament of intellectuals and the underclass, and exploring "confusion after enlightenment." Together, these two collections laid the foundation for modern realistic fiction.
- The True Story of Ah Q*
It creates the classic character "Ah Q," satirizing the national flaws of numbness and self-deception through his "spiritual victory method." It has become an eternal model for analyzing national character and has been translated into dozens of languages worldwide.
- Prose Poem Collection: Wild Grass
With exotic imagery and profound philosophical thinking, it depicts loneliness and resistance, such as The Passer-by and Autumn Night. Combining poetic charm with critical power, it is the pinnacle of modern Chinese prose poetry.
- Prose Collection: Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk
Recalling childhood, studies, and old acquaintances, works like From Baicao Garden to Sanwei Study and Mr. Fujino blend warmth with reflection, featuring simple yet touching writing.
- Essay Collections: Hot Wind, Canopy of Leaves, etc.
He elevated essays into a weapon for social criticism, characterized by sharp language and rigorous logic, aiming to "expose illnesses to arouse attention to treatment." These works influenced the paradigm of essay writing for later generations.
 
<p>2. Core Ideology</p>
 
- Core: "Cultivating People" and Enlightenment
Criticizing the oppression of human nature by feudal ethics, he advocated individual liberation and spiritual independence, hoping to achieve national rejuvenation through ideological awakening.
- Persisting in the Critique of National Character
He profoundly analyzed national flaws such as numbness, ignorance, and selfishness, not to ridicule but to arouse reflection.
- Upholding an Uncompromising Fighting Spirit
He resolutely criticized all phenomena of darkness, hypocrisy, and injustice, adhering to the social conscience and independent personality of intellectuals.
 
<p>III. Literary Achievements and Historical Influence</p>
 
- Literary Innovation
He pioneered mature vernacular Chinese writing, reaching groundbreaking heights in novels, essays, prose poems, and other genres, establishing a paradigm for modern literature.
- Spiritual Legacy
Famous quotes such as "A true warrior dares to face the bleak life" and "There is no road in the world; when many people walk, it becomes a road" have integrated into the national language and spiritual blood.
- Education and Dissemination
His works are included in Chinese textbooks more than any other writer, influencing generations of Chinese people. With numerous global translations, Western masters such as Jean-Paul Sartre praised his critical spirit, making him a core representative of Chinese literature "going global."
- Profound Influence
His critical realism and enlightenment thought have profoundly influenced later writers, becoming a spiritual benchmark for Chinese intellectuals and remaining an important ideological resource for observing society and reflecting on human nature to this day.
